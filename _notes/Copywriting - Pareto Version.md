All of copywriting can be summed up with the following useful mental model: 
Your copy should fall somewhere on the axis between Pleasure & Pain. 

In other words, Are you trying to move away from Pain and towards Pleasure ? Are you focusing on maximizing pleasure? Or avoiding pain ? 

For example, if you're selling a course on personal finance, are you "getting people out of bad debt" ( pain ) or selling "the vacation home in the bahamas" ?  ( pleasure ).
