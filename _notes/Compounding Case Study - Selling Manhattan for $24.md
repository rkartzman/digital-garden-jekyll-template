**Did the Native Americans make a good deal when they sold Manhattan to the Dutch for $24?**

This is the premise of a talk given by Monish Pabrai[^1]. And his answer contradicts the common interpretation that the Dutch took advantage of the Native Americans when they made that deal, and the answer is due to one thing: the power of compounding. 

Assume the Native Americans had a money manager that said, with this $24 I can invest it and get a 7% return. 

The back of the envelope compounding math is as follows: 

1626 -> 2024: ~400 years 
Assume a 7% return -> rule of 72; your money doubles every 10 years
Doubling every 10 years means it will double 10 times in a 100 year period, therefore 2^10 = 1024; 

For every 100 year period you multiply your money by ~1000. 

400 years later that $24 would equal **24 trillion**. 

If you add up the value of the undeveloped land today, excluding the buildings built on top of it, it wouldn't be worth $24 trillion. 

The entire wealth of the planet is $300 trillion. The wealth of the united states is $80 trillion. It's very unlikely that the land value of manhattan alone is worth 30% of the entire wealth of the United States. 


Ultimately if they had held on to the island until 2024, they would have actually **lost** value by holding on to it. 

Of course, this isn't the reality of how that transaction unfolded, but it's a useful way of thinking about capital allocation, opportunity cost, and compounding.
