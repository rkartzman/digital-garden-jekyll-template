title: Expensive
---

Expensive is a term used to convey one's subjective value of a thing, not a statement of fact.  And it's a way for others to implicitly pass judgement on how you choose to spend your money. It's important to live by your own standards of what is valuable. 

"Your rent is so expensive". It's only expensive if the value it creates its less than or equal to the cost. That's it. 

Choosing to live in an 'expensive' market, produces second order benefits. It makes you eligible for a larger pool of jobs, that command higher salaries. 

Why do those companies pay so much more? It's not out of altruism. It's a function of the employees cost of living, which is a function of the demand to live in a particular location and the supply of homes to choose from. By definition what you get paid must exceed your cost of living, or in other words the value you get from living in that city exceeds the cost to live there. 

Goes without saying that on an absolute basis, some things cost a lot more than others. But that's not what people are referring to when they say X is expensive.
