title: Expensive
---

Expensive is a term used to convey one's subjective value of a thing, not a statement of fact.  And it's a way for others to implicitly pass judgement on how you choose to spend your money. 

You need a framework for thinking about what's important and *worth it* to you.  Otherwise you'll be living according to someone else's standards of value, which is exactly what leads to keeping up with the joneses. You need to be making effective capital allocation decisions at the personal level. See [[Iron Law of Economic Survival]]. 

"Your rent is so expensive". It's only expensive if the value it creates its less than or equal to the cost. That's it. 

Choosing to live in an 'expensive' market, produces second order benefits. It makes you eligible for a larger pool of jobs, that command higher salaries. 

Why do those companies pay so much more? It's not out of altruism. It's a function of the employees cost of living, which is a function of the demand to live in a particular location and the supply of homes to choose from. By definition what you get paid must exceed your cost of living, or in other words the value you get from living in that city exceeds the cost to live there. 

Costco isn't successful purely because they offer the cheapest products. They offer *the best products* at the cheapest price. A warehouse full of purely cheap goods would not create the most value for the customer. Optimize for what's important to you in life, and ruthlessly cut costs everywhere else.  

A lot of life lessons to be learned from Costco. 

Goes without saying that on an absolute basis, some things cost a lot more than others. But that's not what people are referring to when they say X is expensive.
