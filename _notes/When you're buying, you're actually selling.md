title: When you're buying, you're actually selling
---

This idea came to me while reading a book called "The E-myth". There is a section describing Ray Kroc's main insight from McDonalds was that he wasn't in the business of selling hamburgers, he was in the business of selling McDonald's *the business* to other business owners. Obviously the main idea here is that as a small business owner, you should be thinking about the business as a whole as the main product. 

But this got me thinking about the business of buying real estate as an investment, or any other private equity style acquisition. 

The majority of people think buying a piece of real estate as an investment in an asset that people would want to live in, and they make money from either people renting it out or selling it to a family etc. 

That's certainly part of it. But where do you make the most money from investing in real estate? Upon sale. And when people talk about "the real estate market", at the most basic level they are talking about a marketplace where money is exchanged for property rights. And what group of people has the most amount of money to participate in this marketplace? Investors. 

Therefore, when you're buying a piece of real estate, your *real* customer is the future buyer. Private equity firms and other real estate investors understand this. That's why the underwriting of a deal is actually where the money is made. 

There are a ton of insights to gain from doing your underwriting from the perspective of your future buyer and how that mindset can completely change about which numbers are important to you. It's never just NOI, or IRR, or Cash-on-cash.
